# Intro

- neg-words and NPIs
- usual assumptions: syntax vs. semantics/pragmatics
- examples: English vs. Hungarian:

Senki 		nem jött.
neg-body 	neg came 

- cracks in the picture:
- equatives (no place for sentential negation operator)
- probability contexts: _nestal se ani desátníkem_ vs. _#nestal se žádným desátníkem_
- by speaker variation: speakers who accept strong NPIs in equatives reject them in NRs but other speakers reject it in equatives and accept it with NRs
	
	- some speakers grammaticalize them as neg-words (speakers A) but some grammaticalize them as strong NPIs

- the switching shows that (at least in strict negative concord languages) the two groups are very close to each other (which contrasts with their theoretical grasp)

# The experiment

(start here)

- all the details
- at the beginning mention the previous experiments
- the four environments
- focus on correlations
- add from the previous experiments

# Back to theories

- the semantic theory of neg-words
- indefinite descriptions plus no at-issue meaning
- schematically: truth conditions plus the presuppositions (not at-issue meaning)
- NPIs: *even* theory of NPIs plus the strong component (look up Crnič)
- another byproduct: equatives (correlative analysis)

- open problems:
- locality restrictions
- Kuhn: QR-like
- empirical question:

()	a. Jedna sestřička zajistí, aby každý pacient dostal lék. Ty sestřičky pak odevzdají zprávu o celém procesu.
	b. ???Petr nezajistí, aby žádný pacient zůstal bez léku.

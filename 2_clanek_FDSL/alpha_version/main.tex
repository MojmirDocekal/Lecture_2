\abstract{This article reports the results of an experiment targetting the acceptability of Czech neg-words and strong NPIs under Neg-Raising predicates and in the complement clauses of equatives. The theoretical consequences of the results are discussed and range from the support of non-standard negative concord theories to the support of non-standard degree semantics for the equative constructions.
